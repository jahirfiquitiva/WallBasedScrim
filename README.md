![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-27%2B-34bf49.svg)

Simple Xposed module that will re-enable wallpaper based tint in some roms.

It basically will disable the changes done in [this commit](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_frameworks_base/commit/759d6831f0207f8b59445b33fd57d770c16d3750) originally done for LineageOS but that many roms are implementing lately.
